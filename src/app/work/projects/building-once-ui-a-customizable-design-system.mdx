## Overview

OptiGrade is an intelligent academic companion powered by AI and machine learning, designed to empower university students through personalized forecasting, strategic study planning, and adaptive feedback. Currently in development as a mobile app for iOS and Android, with future plans for a web application, OptiGrade is poised to revolutionize how students approach their academic journey.

## The Vision: Smarter Learning, Better Outcomes

OptiGrade analyzes each user’s academic history, learning habits, course performance, and behavioral patterns to deliver tailored study recommendations and real-time CGPA projections. By merging predictive modeling with practical study tools, the app helps students make informed decisions, manage their time effectively, and boost their academic outcomes with confidence.

Unlike traditional GPA calculators or generic study planners, OptiGrade creates a full-circle feedback loop. Forecast insights inform study plans, completed tasks update progress metrics, and evolving user behavior refines future predictions. This closed-loop design is a core innovation that truly distinguishes OptiGrade from one-size-fits-all educational platforms.

## Key Features

OptiGrade offers a comprehensive suite of core features that support learning efficiency and goal-oriented study:

-   **GPA and CGPA Prediction Engine**: Utilizes machine learning models trained on course histories, grading patterns, and individual behaviors to forecast academic performance with high accuracy.
-   **Responsive Performance Dashboard**: Visualizes progress, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and provides intelligent insights that evolve over time.
-   **Study Planner and Goal Tracker**: Generates personalized daily and weekly tasks based on forecast data and workload.
-   **Streamlined Recommendation Engine**: Adapts over time to the user's learning style, habits, and feedback inputs, guiding students through their semester journey.

To further support practical academic management, OptiGrade includes modular tools designed for flexibility and relevance:

-   **Custom GPA Calculator**: For quick performance checks.
-   **Timetable Entry Support**: Allows users to plan out lectures, study sessions, and breaks.
-   **Notebook Log**: For saving notes, summaries, or thoughts during study.
-   **Intelligent Reminders and Alarms**: To keep users on schedule.
-   **Built-in Study Timer**: To enable focus blocks, Pomodoro-style sessions, and activity tracking.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the primary challenges has been developing a robust and accurate machine learning model that can genuinely personalize forecasts and recommendations across diverse academic profiles. This has involved extensive data collection, rigorous model training, and continuous refinement based on testing and feedback. Another learning curve has been designing a mobile-first application that is both intuitive for students and technically capable of handling complex AI functionalities. Ensuring seamless data synchronization across devices, even with offline capabilities, also required careful architectural planning.
